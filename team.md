Hi there! I'm a recent grad from Penn State with a BS in Computer Science. Right now, I'm working on my MS in computer science at Boston University Metropolitan College. I'm really into SQL-related database development and deployment, and I love using Python most of the time. It's such a versatile and powerful language. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn more about data science and programming.
